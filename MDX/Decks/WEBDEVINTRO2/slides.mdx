HISTORY OF WEB DEVELOPMENT

![History of web development](https://ik.imagekit.io/sld/WebDevHistory_x9FsqptLOOHP.gif)

---

![Lets Begin](https://media.giphy.com/media/eHFSpEGnvxSI8NpTaS/giphy.gif)

<Notes>
  The origins of the internet go way back to the 1960s, with the US military‚Äôs
  Arpanet project linking computers remotely for the first time.
</Notes>

---

## üöÄ Significant milestones were achieved in the following years as technology improved.

<Notes>


- The first email message sent, generally credited to Ray Tomlinson, who also pioneered the use of the @ symbol.

- USENET went live in 1979. This was a precursor to modern-day social media and allowed enthusiasts to share memes and descend into obtuse arguments online for the first time.

- The domain name system (DNS) was established in 1983, with the first .com registered by Symbolics Computer Corporation in 1985.

</Notes>


---

# WWW

<Notes>
  However, web development as we know it today began when Tim Berners Lee
  created Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) in the early 1990s. This was the
  catalyst for the modern World Wide Web, and HTML still forms the backbone of
  virtually every web page ever created.
</Notes>

---

![Fight!](https://media.giphy.com/media/VRGjEAWPQvsxG/giphy.gif)

# The Browser wars

<Notes>
  During the early 1990s, ‚Äòweb developer‚Äô was not a recognised profession. A
  variety of different roles, such as; designer, content manager and programmer
  were conglomerated under the term webmaster.
</Notes>

---

![Mosaic](https://dayintechhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mosaic1.gif)

<Notes>
  The introduction of the Mosaic web browser in 1993 brought with it the
  emergence of the Front-end Web Developer, as graphical user interfaces became
  possible for the first time. This early era also introduced the browser wars,
  as competing web browser vendors attempted to outdo each other with
  proprietary features and quirks.
</Notes>

---

# üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠

<Notes>
  This made the developer‚Äôs job very difficult, as it was almost impossible to
  guarantee that a web page would look and function as intended across different
  browsers without making separate versions of the same page.
</Notes>

---

# User expectations were not particularly high during this period.

<Notes>
  Many popular websites were produced by hobbyists and browsing the web was a
  bit of a Wild West experience. Accepted standards of design and accessibility
  had not yet been established.
</Notes>

---

![SpaceJam](https://ik.imagekit.io/sld/Screenshot_2021-01-19_at_20.59.41_B-zrhkWp0DQC.png)

<Notes>
  Developers came up with many innovative solutions to get around these
  limitations, such as using tables to control layout and infamous spacer gif
  files (an invisible gif file used to force a layout into the correct
  position).
</Notes>

---

# üéâ Getting flashy

<Notes>
  Towards the end of the 1990s, Macromedia‚Äôs Flash (later acquired by Adobe)
  seemed to open up a whole new world of possibilities for developers frustrated
  by HTML‚Äôs limitations.
</Notes>

---

### The technology delivered content in a browser plugin rather than relying on the browser‚Äôs own proprietary features.

<Notes>
  This allowed animated, interactive content to be produced that would work on
  the majority of end-users‚Äô computers.
</Notes>

---

# However, it also led to some issues üò≠

<Notes>
  Most users relied on slow modem connections and Flash websites could take a
  long time to load. Search Engines were unable to crawl sites created purely
  using Flash, causing difficulties for sites relying on organic search for
  traffic. Accessibility problems - users relying on assistive technology could
  face severe difficulties navigating through Flash sites. Even the most simple
  content updates would require a Flash developer to implement, making websites
  very costly to maintain. It required the plugin to be installed in the first
  place. This could often lead to scenes like the below.
</Notes>

---

![Steve Jobs](https://media.giphy.com/media/CTkWFZ1IDvsfS/giphy.gif)

<Notes>
  When Steve Jobs announced in 2010 that iOS devices would no longer support
  Flash, it effectively killed it off as a viable platform for web development.
</Notes>

---

![2000](https://media.giphy.com/media/ln6u0EgyDg5c4nrl1R/giphy.gif)

<Notes>
  As we moved into the 2000s, there was a growing grassroots movement to
  establish independent standards for web technologies. Groups like the World
  Wide Web Consortium began to exert influence over the industry in an effort to
  make the web accessible for all and ensure that advancements were not driven
  by the profit motive of individual technology companies.
</Notes>

---

## ‚úÖ Gradually, browsers and developers began to adopt a standards-based approach.

<Notes>
  This has led to widespread adoption of open source technology and a greater
  focus on the experience of the end user.
</Notes>

---

## ü§Æ A major issue with HTML-based websites at this time was that content and presentational code were mixed in together in one document.

<Notes>
  This made it very difficult for a non-developer to update a website and caused
  maintenance problems, e.g if a company wished to change a brand colour then
  they would have to ask their developers to individually update many individual
  pages wherever the colour was used.
</Notes>

---

# Building sites with style (sheets)

<Notes>
  CSS gradually gained widespread adoption and became the standard language used
  to separate presentation from content. As web browsers moved towards
  standardisation, developers could build more accessible, functional and
  performant sites. Content editors could update with confidence, knowing that a
  wrong move would not completely break the site‚Äôs layout.
</Notes>

---

![Easy!](https://media.giphy.com/media/dWy2WwcB3wvX8QA1Iu/giphy.gif)

<Notes>
  In many ways, this made the developer‚Äôs job easier but for some, it meant
  having to learn an entirely new language and process for producing websites;
  unlearning carefully mastered techniques that had now become obsolete.
</Notes>

---

# JS

<Notes>
  Javascript became the standard language used to add interactivity to web
  pages. Unfortunately, differences in how web browsers interpret this language
  made it very challenging to prevent bugs and inconsistencies in the end-user
  experience.
</Notes>

---

# jQuery ü§Æ

<Notes>
  The jQuery framework emerged as a ‚Äúwrapper‚Äù around the Javascript language in
  a (largely successful) attempt to iron out these inconsistencies by giving
  developers a standard method to add interactivity that would work across the
  majority of browsers. jQuery became an essential part of the front-end
  developer‚Äôs toolbox.
</Notes>

---

# The state of play

<Notes>
  We have reached a stage where standards have become widely accepted, Internet
  Explorer is being phased out (yay!) and front-end development has become
  relatively mature.
</Notes>

---

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/RD2n7uh3PjGg/giphy.gif)

<Notes>
  The proliferation of smartphones and other web-enabled devices has brought a
  new set of challenges to the fore. Responsive, mobile-first development is the
  de facto standard practice to address this. Websites are now produced in such
  a way that the user experience is optimised for users on small screens and
  additional features are added to enhance the experience on larger screens.
</Notes>

---

## Web users now expect a fast, accessible and seamless experience on whatever device they use to access a site.

<Notes>
  This has led to a trend for function over flash in web design and a much
  greater focus on the needs of the end-user.
</Notes>

---

## Front-end development is no longer about hacking together web pages.

<Notes>
  Modern user interfaces should provide an ‚Äúapp like‚Äù experience. Today
  developers must adopt best practice from both software engineering and user
  interface design.
</Notes>

---

## It is still an incredibly fast-moving profession, with new frameworks and trends emerging constantly.

---

## However; HTML, CSS and Javascript are still the core technologies that underpin everything that is built to be viewed in a web browser.

<Notes>This is unlikely to change in the near future.</Notes>

FUTURE OF WEB DEVELOPMENT
-->

![Future](https://media.giphy.com/media/ZZkCo8zKWtt2ZgozfX/giphy.gif)

---

# The office is dead

- no commute
- better work life balance
- live where you want

---

# üè° Companies embraced WFH

---

## üåé Microsoft and Apple will continue to allow employees to work remotely

---

# üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Exodus from silicon valley

---

## College degrees no longer required for jobs at FANG for software engineers

---

## üíº Job market more competitive as you have to compete with the entire world

---

## üöÄ Our industry performed way better in these weird times than anyone other field.

---

## üòé Typescript will continue to dominate - especially with Deno being a thing.

---

# üëÄ I'm gonna sidetrack here for a minute for the JS nerds

---

# What is Deno?

---

### A secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript.

---

### Solves the same problems as NodeJS and was made by the same guy.

---

### "(node) could have been much nicer"

_- Ryan Dahl_

---

### Uses the [V8 JavaScript engine](https://github.com/v8/v8).

(Like node!)

---

### Runtime implemented in Rust and Typescript.

---

### Hit release candidate 1.0.0 in 2020

(early adoption)

---

### Deno is **_secure by default_**

---

You as the developer need to give permissions to perform certain actions in the runtime.

### _Prevents security holes._

---

<Editor
  title="Example main.ts:"
  codeOnly
  noPadBottom
  code={`
// Print the current working directory
console.log( Deno.cwd() )
`}
/>

<Editor
  noPadTop
  title="Can be run with:"
  codeOnly
  code={`
// Explicit permission from dev to allow deno to read files.
deno run --allow-read main.ts
`}
/>

---

<Editor
  codeOnly
  title="Supports top level await:"
  code={`
const res = await fetch('https://sld.codes')
// no async function needed!
`}
/>

---

<Editor
  title="Browser compatible events:"
  codeOnly
  code={`
window.onload = e=> console.log("Yo!")
`}
/>

---

# You can also execute Web Assembly Binaries

---

# No more NPM üò≤

---

<Editor
  title="Remote modules referenced by their URL:"
  codeOnly
  code={`
import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std@v0.42.0/http/server.ts";
`}
/>

---

## When script is run for the first time it will download and cache imports.

## No package.json and code can be referenced from any URL.

---

### Main Advantages:

- Secure by default
- Browser compatible APIs.
- Test runner, file watcher and bundler baked in.
- No node modules, package.json instead reference URL.

---

### Simple server demo:

<Editor
  title="main.ts"
  noPadBottom
  noPadTop
  codeOnly
  code={`
import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std@v0.42.0/http/server.ts";
const s = serve({ port: 8000 });
console.log("http://localhost:8000/");
for await (const req of s) {
  req.respond({ body: "Hello World" });
}
`}
/>

<Editor
  noPadTop
  title="Run with:"
  codeOnly
  code={`
deno run --allow-net  main.ts
`}
/>

---

# üëÄ Anyway!

---

## Web apps and native apps will draw nearer each other.

---

## You can now create websites that have push notifications, offline mode, bluetooth, background sync and more!

(These things used to be reserved for native apps)

---

# [WebAuthn demo](https://webauthn.sld.codes/)

---

## More and more apps will just wrap web pages.

---

## Artifical Intelligence will not take your job

---

## Lots of tools out there to help those with no coding experience create apps üòÖ

---

# [webflow.com](webflow.com)

---

# So it will take my job?

---

## No. We're just more likely to focus on the stuff it can't handle.

---

## We will be able to follow the DRY principle even easier.

---

## The server is dead.

### Its expensive!

---

# Serverless is King.

---

# Whats serverless?

<Notes>
  Serverless computing (or serverless for short), is an execution model where
  the cloud provider (AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud) is responsible for executing
  a piece of code by dynamically allocating the resources. And only charging for
  the amount of resources used to run the code
</Notes>

---

# Serverless Databases

---

# [Fauna](https://fauna.com/) & [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore)

---

# We will spend less time thinking about how we scale.

(It'll just work)

# What's in the box of a modern webpage?

---

# HTML

<Notes>
  - HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language - Every webpage in the world is
  HTML. It‚Äôs the main thing web browsers understand. - HTML describes the page‚Äôs
  content as a series of elements.
</Notes>

---

# CSS

<Notes>
  - CSS is a series of rules that applies to ‚Äúselectors‚Äù - You can either
  include a stylesheet, or define the style on the element directly - You can
  change different predefined properties of things
</Notes>

---

# JavaScript

<Notes>
  - Named that way to be appealing to Java Devs - Allows you to implement
  complex features on web pages.
</Notes>

---

# Getting Practical

Introducing you to two modern industry-leading front-end technologies (ReactJS & GatsbyJS)

---

# NPM

---

# Node Package Manager

<Notes>
  NPM is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language. It is the
  default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js. It
  consists of a command line client, also called npm, and an online database of
  public and paid-for private packages, called the npm registry. The registry is
  accessed via the client, and the available packages can be browsed and
  searched via the npm website. The package manager and the registry are managed
  by npm, Inc. NPM is included as a recommended feature in Node.js installer.npm
  consists of a command line client that interacts with a remote registry. It
  allows users to consume and distribute JavaScript modules that are available
  on the registry.
</Notes>

---

# 1,000,000+ packages üöÄ

## Your in your card and want to turn up the AC

<Notes>
  In an old car you would use a dial to turn up the temprature yourself until
  you're at right temprature.
</Notes>

---

## This is like JQuery

<Notes>
  You would grab the element in the dom get the text value increase it and set
  the element to the new value in the browser.
</Notes>

---

## But React is more like a Tesla.

<Notes>
  You set the exact temprature that you want and then the car then decides
  whether you need to make it cooler or warmer. I just want it at X degrees and
  it just does it. Me as a user dont need to worry about which parts of the
  application to change.
</Notes>

---

## Lets dive into the code!

---

<Editor
  noPadBottom
  codeOnly
  code={`
import React from "react";
import ReactDom from "react-dom";
ReactDom.render(<div>hello</div>, document.getElementById("root"));
`}
/>

React itself is a blueprint. ReactDom uses that blueprint to make the user interface.

---

## What if I want to use the same code to build mobile UIs?

---

<Editor
  codeOnly
  code={`
import React from "react";
import ReactNative from "react-native";
ReactNative.render(<div>hello</div>, document.getElementById("root"));
`}
/>

---

#### If you are seeing this for the first time you might be thinking:

## _"You're putting HTML in my Javascript. You must be f\*\*\*ing kidding me!"_

---

# This is not HTML

#### This is JSX. Its a templating language that looks like HTML.

---

<Editor
  codeOnly
  code={`
import React from "react";
import ReactDom from "react-dom";
let reactElement = <div>hello</div>;
ReactDom.render(reactElement, document.getElementById("root"));
`}
/>

---

<Editor
  noPadBottom
  codeOnly
  code={`
import React from "react";
import ReactDom from "react-dom";
let reactElement = React.createElement("div", null, "hello");
ReactDom.render(reactElement, document.getElementById("root"));
`}
/>

This is the exact same thing! Some people prefer this as its looks more like JS.

---

<Editor
  noPadBottom
  codeOnly
  code={`
import React from "react";
import ReactDom from "react-dom";
let text = "Yo";
let reactElement = React.createElement("div", null, text);
ReactDom.render(reactElement, document.getElementById("root"));
`}
/>

It allows you to get even more abstract!

---

<Editor
  codeOnly
  code={`
import React from "react";
import ReactDom from "react-dom";
let text = "Yo";
let reactElement = React.createElement("div", null, () => {
  return text + "!!!!!!!!";
});
ReactDom.render(reactElement, document.getElementById("root"));
`}
/>

---

## You could have React.createElement inside a React.createElement!

---

## And the more you do this, the grosser it gets.

---

# OR you could use JSX!

---

<Editor

# What is GatsbyJS?

---

> You get simplicity by finding slightly more sophisticated building blocks.

By [_Alan Kay_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdSD07U5uBs)

---

## A static site generator

- Produces static html files that we load up onto a server.
- No data querying done server side - all sorted at build.

---

## Static site !== static page

We can still add all the JS we want to do dynamic things.

---

## Uses GraphQL to get data from anywhere

We could get content from files, databases other websites - the list goes on!

## Gatsby generates pages for you

- Pass Gatsby content, define a template and it will programmatically create pages for you.
- Gatsby uses Node to generate these pages in development.

---

## üîå Built with a plugin architecture

Abstract complex, configurations, or reusable code into a plugin so its away from what your focused on.

---

## üí™ Harnesses ReactJS

Gatsby uses react and stylesheets to help structure page layout.

# Why use Gatsby?

---

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Speed

Its hard to beat the speed of sending static output.

---

## üîë Security

Extremely secure as you are just sending HTML.

---

## üòç Developer Experience

---

#### Takes away logic we all find pernickety:

- _react-router_
- _progressive-image-loading_
- _data-fetching_

---

- modern dev enviroment
- simple tooling
- modern and clean languages

---

# üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Its growing fast.

### Gatsby has a solid team, open source community and awesome documentation.

---

#### npm stats

![GATSBY STATS](https://ik.imagekit.io/sld/gatsbyStats_P_fCfBD7g.png)

---

#### Built with Gatsby

- [The Official React Javascript Library Website](https://reactjs.org/)
- [The Impossible Foods‚Äô Brand Website](https://impossiblefoods.com/)
- [The Airbnb Sites for Developers and Designers](https://airbnb.io/)

## UX design

---

# What is UX?

---

# User eXperience

---

## UX design is the process of creating products that provide meaningful and personally relevant experiences.

---

- Conducting user research
- Creating user personas
- Determining the information architecture of a digital product
- Designing user flows and wireframes
- Creating prototypes
- Conducting user testing **and soo much more!**

---

## I think every front-end engineer should be a UX ambassador.

---

# üí° Create with your users in mind

---

# The five second rule

<Notes>
  Visitors should be able to tell what your site has to offer within the first
  five seconds of landing on your homepage. This is the average time users need
  to form a first impression and decide whether it‚Äôs worth engaging with
  content. To retain visitors, a landing page must clearly convey its purpose,
  what content is on offer and a strong call to action.
</Notes>

---

# First steps

<Notes>
  Most website traffic will come from external links such as search engines or
  site links, rather than from users who know your URL (a great web hosting
  service will give you the analytics you need). As a result, users are likely
  to land on your website with a specific goal. Your site should satisfy this
  goal by providing engaging, relevant and valuable information through an easy
  to use interface. It‚Äôs also likely that users who are directed to your site
  from another source will land on a deeper page of your website. Therefore, all
  website pages need to be designed to clearly communicate what information can
  be found there to avoid high bounce rates.
</Notes>

---

# Minimal Design

<Notes>
  The information users are looking for on your site needs to be presented in a
  clean and simple way (a website builder will help if you need to keep things
  simple). If any element of the page doesn‚Äôt need to be there, get rid of it.
  In terms of copy, communicating key information in fewer words is more
  effective than offering long bodies of text that users will skim read. Avoid
  clutter and keep decorative elements minimal; fewer distractions allow users
  to find what they‚Äôre looking for, faster.
</Notes>

---

# Consistency

<Notes>
  Keep design consistent across pages so users can easily find information. For
  example, the main menu should always have the same elements, no matter which
  page it features on. Similarly, clicks should always perform the same action ‚Äì
  for instance, clicking on a link should always open it on a new window.
  Consistent design enables your users to learn how to navigate your site
  quickly and effectively.
</Notes>

---

# Standard design patterns

<Notes>
  Designing the layout and navigation for a website requires you to follow
  tired-and-tested trends. This means using standard design patterns and taking
  inspiration from successful websites, which will also encourage cross-browser
  compatibility across devices. Keep any design system files in secure cloud
  storage for your whole team to access.
</Notes>

---

# Structured content

<Notes>
The information you put on your website needs to be arranged and grouped into pages and the resulting structure will form the navigation and logic for your menu. Within each page, you‚Äôll also need to organise information; if content isn‚Äôt visible on the screen before scrolling down, then there‚Äôs a high chance that users will miss it.


Calls to action should also prompt users to scroll through to uncover more information. When it comes to a website‚Äôs homepage, it should contain a brief summary on the brand and what it does, so that users know what to expect from the site.

</Notes>

### Users spend most of their time on other sites. This means that users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know.

# üå± AKA Copy

### or at least get inspired!

# Colour Theory

The colours that you use to represent yourself matter

---

#### Induce the right emotion in your users by using appropriate colours.
