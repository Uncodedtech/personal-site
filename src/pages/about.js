            works as a UX Engineer at BehaviourLab. He is most at home coding in
            React, Javascript, GraphQL & Gatsby but is always open to learning
            something new. When coding he likes to ensure his code is accessible
            and performant. <br /> <br /> He enjoys teaching the next generation

            Sam Larsen-Disney studied a Bachelors in Computer Science at
            King&apos;s College London. During his time there he taught an AI to
            play pacman and built a visual search engine that attempted to
            combat fake news. He found university frustrating as most of the
            things he learned were theoretical. He likes the work he does to
            provide value and it was because of this that he could not wait to
            join the world of work.
            <br /> <br /> He joined American Express on their technology summer
            internship in 2017. During his ten weeks as a Software Engineer at
            American Express he worked within an agile team delivering an
            internal data visualisation tool. The summer strengthened his
            competency in the Elastic Stack and Java. The company culture was
            really good and, when they offered him a graduate position, he did
            not hesitate to say “yes!“. He completed two 6 month rotations on
            the graduate scheme. He tried his hand as a Front End developer and
            User Experience Designer and realised that he wanted his role to be
            a mixture of the two. Since then he has worked in the “refer a
            friend“ and the “Design Language System“ teams as a Design Engineer.
            He helped design and build American Express&apos; websites. Since
            then he has moved to BehaviourLab where he leads front-end
            development. When coding he likes to ensure his code is accessible
            and performant. He has always enjoyed leading people. He was the
            only graduate in his cohort to formally manage interns and has gone
            on to be the youngest engineer to manage graduates. <br /> <br />
            When not in the office he likes to attend hackathons. At these
            events he enjoys teaching the next generation to code and has a bit
            of a reputation for staying up all night. He also likes to take
            photos, write about tech and tinker with weekend coding projects.
